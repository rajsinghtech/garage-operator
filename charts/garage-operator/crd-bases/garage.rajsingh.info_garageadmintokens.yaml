              GarageAdminTokenSpec defines the desired state of GarageAdminToken
              Admin tokens are used to authenticate with the Garage Admin API.
              They are separate from S3 access keys (GarageKey).

              Note: This operator uses file-based admin tokens (loaded via admin_token_file in TOML config).
              File-based tokens always have full admin access. For scoped/restricted tokens, use Garage's
              Admin API token management (CreateAdminToken, UpdateAdminToken) directly.
