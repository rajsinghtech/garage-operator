                  Note: Permissions can be granted from either direction:
                  - Here (GarageBucket.keyPermissions): Grant keys access to this bucket
                  - On GarageKey (GarageKey.bucketPermissions): Grant the key access to buckets

                  Both approaches are equivalent and result in the same Garage API calls.
                  Use whichever is more convenient for your workflow:
                  - Bucket-centric: Define all key access on the bucket
                  - Key-centric: Define all bucket access on the key

                  If the same permission is defined in both places, they are merged (not conflicting).
