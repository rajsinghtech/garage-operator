              GarageNodeSpec defines the desired state of GarageNode.

              GarageNode represents a node in the Garage cluster. When the parent GarageCluster
              has layoutPolicy: Manual, each GarageNode creates its own StatefulSet (replica 1)
              with independent storage configuration.

              Use GarageNode when you need:
              - Heterogeneous storage (different storage classes per node)
              - Per-node resource configuration
              - Fine-grained zone/capacity control
              - External nodes (VMs, other K8s clusters)

              Pod configuration (resources, nodeSelector, tolerations, etc.) is inherited from
              the parent GarageCluster and can be overridden per-node.

                        Valid operators are Exists, Equal, Lt, and Gt. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                        Lt and Gt perform numeric comparisons (requires feature gate TaintTolerationComparisonOperators).

                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
